# In this project, we integrated a 3 axis ADXL 335 accelerometer with a TelosB mote 
# and wrote a motion detection routine using TinyOS. Then we used 7 motes where each 
# mote would signal one musical note (vertical motion for minor and horizontal for major). 
# The detected motion is relayed to a base station mote connected to a speaker that plays the tune.
